Random Forest

Dataset Description:

Use the Glass dataset and apply the Random forest model.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the dataset.
Check for missing values, outliers, inconsistencies in the data.

2: Data Visualization:

Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, or pair plots to visualize the distributions and relationships between features.
Analyze any patterns or correlations observed in the data.

3: Data Preprocessing

1. Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on a strategy for handling them.Implement the chosen strategy (e.g., imputation or removal) and explain your reasoning.
2. If there are categorical variables, apply encoding techniques like one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical format.
3. Apply feature scaling techniques such as standardization or normalization to ensure that all features are on a similar scale. Handling the imbalance data.

4: Random Forest Model Implementation
1. Divide the data into train and test split.
2. Implement a Random Forest classifier using Python and a machine learning library like scikit-learn.
3. Train the model on the train dataset. Evaluate the performance on test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5: Bagging and Boosting Methods
Apply the Bagging and Boosting methods and compare the results.


Additional Notes:
1. Explain Bagging and Boosting methods. How is it different from each other.
Ans) 
Bagging:It's a ML Technique where multiple models are trained independently on different subsets of the training data. These subsets are created by random sampling with replacement (bootstrap sampling).

Parameters:
Estimator: 0.7--> 7 Columns
Max Samples: 0.6--> 60 Rows
n_Estimator: 100
these Bagging works for all Decision Tree, KNN, SVm etc...

Boosting: Use to reduce errors in predictive data analysis, where Each subsequent model focuses on learning from the mistakes made by the previous models. It mainly focus on incorrectly predicted data. Boosting methods iteratively train weak learners (models that are slightly better than random guessing) and combine them to form a strong learner.
Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting (GBM), XGBoost, LightGBM


2. Explain how to handle imbalance in the data.
Ans) Imbalanced datasets occur when one class is significantly more frequent than another class. This can lead to biased models that favor the majority class. Several techniques can be used to handle class imbalance:

Resampling Techniques:
Under-sampling: Randomly remove instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution.
Over-sampling: Randomly replicate instances from the minority class to increase its representation.
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Generates synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between existing instances.

Algorithmic Techniques:
Algorithm Selection: Choose algorithms that are less sensitive to class imbalance, such as decision trees or ensemble methods like Random Forest, which can handle class imbalance better than linear models.
Class Weights: Assign higher weights to minority class instances during model training to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily.

Evaluation Metrics:
Use appropriate evaluation metrics: Accuracy may not be a suitable metric for imbalanced datasets. Instead, consider metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), or area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR).
